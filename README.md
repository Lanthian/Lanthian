### Howdy!
<!-- So I've created the profile readme, now I need to find something to say in it... dilemma, dilemma ðŸŒ€ðŸ§¿ -->
I'm Liam. I'm a BSc graduate from [ðŸŽ“&nbsp;**The University of Melbourne**](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), having majored in Computing and Software Systems. I am now undertaking my Masters in Software Engineering, specialising in Artifical Intelligence. I have a keen interest in mathematics and software development, but puzzles and problem solving of all nature intrigues me. I'm passionate about people and understanding how they interact with the world around them through all kinds of systems - digitally, physically, socially. For me, there really isn't anything more rewarding than insights into the complexities and life of another person.

Anyway, now that the obligatory introduction is said and done, onto the main course. I realise that my page is a *little* barren right now (apologies for the 21 private repositories) but I'll hopefully be able to delete this line soon. For a start, you can check out my ongoing [ðŸ“š&nbsp;Project Euler](https://github.com/Lanthian/project-euler) problem set repository.

If you're an employer or have the ability to employ, I'd love to hear from you. I'd love to hear from you regardless, to be honest. Let me know how your day is going when you see this. :]

Take care of yourself,<br/>
Liam.
